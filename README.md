# Apartment Listing Scraper

Scrapes listings from apartments.com. A work in progress.


> :bulb: This project is for personal learning purposes. :)


## To-Do
- Each apartment building should have id associated in order to link units properly in the future
- :white_check_mark: ~~Get Fees and Policies info~~
- IMPROVE Fees and Policies info
    - the garage/parking tabs have different layouts
    - perhaps a separate function for each category?
- Make function to cycle through each available unit
    - data should include:
        - Unit number
        - price
        - size in sq ft
        - availability (date)
- Add city, state to data
